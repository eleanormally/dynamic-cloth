abstract = {We present an algorithm to efficiently and robustly process collisions, contact and friction in cloth simulation. It works with any technique for simulating the internal dynamics of the cloth, and allows true modeling of cloth thickness. We also show how our simulation data can be post-processed with a collision-aware subdivision scheme to produce smooth and interference free data for rendering.},
